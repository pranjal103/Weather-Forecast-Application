# Weather Forecasting Application 🌤️

Welcome to the **Weather Forecasting Application**! This project allows users to search for current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast by city or using their current location. Built with **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this app fetches data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** and dynamically displays it on the user interface.

## Features 🌟

- **5-Day Forecast**: Provides weather predictions for the next five days, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather description.
- **Recent Searches**: Keeps a history of recently searched cities, allowing users to quickly revisit them.
- **Current Location Search**: Automatically fetches weather data for the user's current location using geolocation.



## How to Use 🛠️

1. **Search by City**: Enter the name of the city in the input box and click the "Search" button to view the current weather and 5-day forecast.
2. **Use Current Location**: Click the "Use Current Location" button to automatically fetch the weather data for your current location.
3. **View Recent Searches**: Click the "Recently Searched Cities" button to view and select from the list of cities you've previously searched.
